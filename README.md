# Object-Detection-Webcam

## *Yolov8l & openCV libraries:*

This project aims to detect objects using a webcam by utilizing the openCV and YOLOv8 libraries. The YOLOv8 model has been utilized for object training. The openCV library is used to capture data from the webcam, identify objects, draw an outline around them, and display their respective class and confidence. With this project, the user can detect objects in real-time using their webcam, and obtain information about the objects identified.

## *NOTE:*

It should be noted that this project utilizes the Nano version of YOLO, which may result in less accurate object detection compared to the larger versions. Additionally, if the user has more than one webcam, they may need to modify the code to specify the appropriate webcam number. Lastly, it is highly recommended to use the user's GPU to run YOLO instead of the CPU, as this can lead to improved efficiency and performance of the project.
